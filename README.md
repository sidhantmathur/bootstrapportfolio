Sidhant Mathur's Portfolio

Complete overhaul of my portfolio, using the best ideas from the old one, and making them cleaner. No longer using a template (other than a standard bootstrap boilerplate).  

Using newly released stable Bootstrap 4.0.0.

Using a vanilla Javascript smooth scroll. 

Todo-List: 

   - New Fonts
   - Color Scheme Tweaking
   - Adding more content to make the scrolling meaningful
   - Add more mobile friendly projects
   - Think of a way to sort the web development projects from most to least relevent to viewers
   - Keep Learning so you can put more stuff on the portfolio!
   - Make Email Contact a Modal
   - subtitles on skills?
   - add sticky nav
   - make cards slide in
   - footer with contact info?
